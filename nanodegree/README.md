# My AI Product Manager Nanodegree

## What

I [embarked on a journey](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/LM5RT9K) to learn how to evaluate the business value of an AI product. From building familiarity and fluency with common AI concepts, to scoping and building a diverse data set, all the way to training a model and evaluating its business impact. 

I equally learnt learn how to ensure the AI product is successful by focusing on scalability, potential biases, and compliance. Along the way, I reviewed case studies and examples to help me focus on how to define metrics to measure the business value for the proposed AI product.

It was an amazing journey, and while at it, I focused on trying to apply AI to some of the biggest health challenges faced by the world's poor.

## Why Focus On Healthcare

Poor access to health services and qualified personnel is a critical problem in Africa, resulting in millions of deaths from preventable and easily treatable diseases like Lower Respiratory Tract Infections (LRTI), which have replaced HIV/Aids as the number one killer in Africa.

Machine Learning promises profund value in healthcare since it can power a product or service that combines very high quality LRTI prediction (diagnosis) and complementary medical advisory, delivered directly to patients or aid clinicians and semi-skilled caregivers provide scalable care without compromising quality.

The impact of this includes timely access to personalised and affordable diagnosis and treatment of LRTI, even for Africaâ€™s poor patients, while aiding clinicians and driving overall ROI.

## Outcome 

I made the case for an [AI mobile product](/portfolio) that provides high quality offline machine-learning powered diagnosis of LRTI to clinicians, community health care givers, and patients.
